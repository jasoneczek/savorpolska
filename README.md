## Overview

The Savor Polska Recipe Website utilizes HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive recipe website. Enhancements include a hamburger menu, temperature converter, form validation, and an image slideshow.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design:** This website is designed to be accessible and user-friendly on desktop and mobile.

2. **Semantic Structure:** Utilizes semantic HTML5 elements to enhance accessibility and content meaning.

3. **Modular Structure:** CSS and JavaScript is organized into modular files for maintainability and scalability.

4. **Hamburger Menu:** Dynamic menu for easy navigation on smaller screens.

5. **Temperature Converter:** Handy tool allowing users to convert temperatures to Fahrenheit.

6. **Form Validation:** JavaScript based validation in forms to ensure correct user input.

7. **Image Slideshow:** Further JavaScript exploration for enhanced user experience.

## Technologies

- **HTML5:** Structure and content.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity, form validation, and dynamic functionality.
- **FontAwesome:** Icons for enhanced visual experience.

## Recipe Navigation

Currently the "Recipes" link in the main navigation opens a dropdown menu, which contains links to individual recipes. Only having 3 recipes on the site at this time, this seemed like a sensible approach.

If I was to develop this site futher, with a growing number of recipes, ideally the "Recipes" dropdown menu would link to different recipe category pages.
